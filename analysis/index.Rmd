## toy data

+ `flash` on toy data: [flash](flash.html)
  + flash successfully recovers the structure from the toy data
  + first 10 factors capture the large group; the next 10 capture the medium-sized group; the others capture the pairwise-interaction

  
+ `flashier` on toy data: [flashier](flashier.html)
  + faster implementation (uses variational inference) and more prior options available
  + estiamted factors are similar

+ (`flash`) precision matrix estimation: [flash_omega](flash_omega.html)
  + precision matrix is estimated from fitted factors and loadings
  + precision matrix effectively captures the structure in toy data
  + the value of each entry of the compressed precision matrix corresponds to the strength of the pairwise position-position interaction
    + from the $Lq \times Lq$ precision matrix, each $q \times q$ submatrix corresponding to a position-position interaction is represented by its Frobeniues norm in the final $L\times L$ compressed precision matrix; 
  + for comparison, covariance matrix is also estimated

+ (`flashier`) precision matrix estimation: [flashier2](flashier2.html)
  + given same setting of point normal prior and column-specific error variance, `flash` and `flashier` produce almost identical results
  + result with nonnegative prior has greater noise

+ ten more toy data: [toy10](toy10.html)
  + due to small sample size, the estimate differs significantly by input data, which are drawn iid from the same data generating process.  
  + greater group size makes 1) detection easier and 2) position-position interaction closer to *conditionally* independent, which corresponds to 0 in precision matrix.
    + average signal size: size-4 group > size-6 group = pairwise interactions
    + signal variability: size-6 group < size-4 group < pairwise interactions 
  + the two forces (1 and 2) would form a different result depending on the underlying structure of the interaction (e.g. toy data's almost deterministic structure or some biological structure of position interactions)

## pdz data

+ precision matrix estimation (`flash` and `flashier`): [pdz](pdz.html)
  + flashier is much faster for this bigger data while flash and flashier produce almost identical results
  + a few strong structures are predicted
  + the low-rank structure seems worth looking into

+ tackling low-rankness of estimated precision matrix: [lowrank](lowrank.html)
  + the model with 191 factors (previously from 50) was estimated when allowed up to 200 factors. And the streaks are all gone
  + sampling from posterior distribution or thresholding with local false sign rate did not help much in removing the low-rankness of the compressed precision matrix (with 50 factors)

+ investigating the 191 pdz factors: [191factors](191factors.html)
  + a factor typically has zero or one strong signal associated with a position, sometimes two signals, and rarely more than that
  + the catalogue of all 191 pdz factors is provided
